# My conf. files

I often use one conf file across all of my devices.

I'm sharing them for here for selfish purposes, :), to keep track of them.

my.gitignore includes ignore rules for: Linux, KDE, Symfony2, CodeIgniter, TextMate, NetBeans, vim and MacOSX files.

my.htaccess includes best practices from HTML5 Boilerplate project.
